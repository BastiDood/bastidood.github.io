                    In my spare time, I write technical blog posts at <a href="https://dev.to">dev.to</a> (<a href="https://dev.to/somedood">@somedood</a>)
                    about various topics in web development, systems programming, and computer science. As such, many of my articles discuss JavaScript best
                    practices, design patterns, performance techniques, and limitations. In other times, I focus on the low-level implications of systems
                    programming patternsâ€”particularly in the context of Rust, C, and C++.

                            Indeed it is. Hollywood films often portray programmers as fast-typing computer wizards who can "hack" into anything. We all know
                            that this can never be farther from the truth. Here is an article that discusses what goes into the many aspects of "real" programming.

                            Learning JavaScript is a wild, tempestuous journey. With so much to learn, it is difficult to keep up with the times. Here are 18 videos
                            I consider to be "essential" in learning JavaScript at a deeper level. Each of these videos once sparked a "eureka moment" within me that
                            ultimately helped in piecing together the JavaScript puzzle.

                            The Rust programming language has steadily been on the rise in terms of adoption and popularity. But is all the hype justified?
                            In this article, I reflect on my experience with Rust in the past year, tackling the golden moments as well as the pain points.

                            At the moment, there is no standardized way to write asynchronous constructors in JavaScript. However, this does not mean there
                            aren't any workarounds! In this article, we will discuss the various ways to emulate <code>async</code> in <code>constructor</code>.
                            Most of them are not-so-ideal, but in the end, I will demonstrate the proper way. Tagged with javascript, typescript, tips, async.
