            In my spare time, I write technical blog posts at <a href="https://dev.to">dev.to</a>
            (<a href="https://dev.to/somedood">@somedood</a>) about various topics in web development, systems
            programming, and computer science. As such, many of my articles discuss JavaScript best practices, design
            patterns, performance techniques, and limitations. In other times, I focus on the low-level implications of
            systems programming patternsâ€”particularly in the context of Rust, C, and C++.

                    Indeed it is. Hollywood films often portray programmers as fast-typing computer wizards who can
                    "hack" into anything. We all know that this can never be farther from the truth. Here is an article
                    that discusses what goes into the many aspects of "real" programming.

                    Learning JavaScript is a wild, tempestuous journey. With so much to learn, it is difficult to keep
                    up with the times. Here are 18 videos I consider to be "essential" in learning JavaScript at a
                    deeper level. Each of these videos once sparked a "eureka moment" within me that ultimately helped
                    in piecing together the JavaScript puzzle.

                    The Rust programming language has steadily been on the rise in terms of adoption and popularity. But
                    is all the hype justified? In this article, I reflect on my experience with Rust in the past year,
                    tackling the golden moments as well as the pain points.

                    At the moment, there is no standardized way to write asynchronous constructors in JavaScript.
                    However, this does not mean there aren't any workarounds! In this article, we will discuss the
                    various ways to emulate <code>async</code> in
                    <code>constructor</code>. Most of them are not-so-ideal, but in the end, I will demonstrate the
                    proper way.

                    Idle code is the antithesis of efficiency. In this article, we will look into various ways to reduce
                    a program's idle time during asynchronous operations. From concepts such as concurrency and proper
                    I/O scheduling, this is the beginning of a series that explores the world of asynchronous
                    JavaScript.
